# Discrete-Time Signal Processing Repository

This repository contains a collection of key topics and techniques in **Discrete-Time Signal Processing**, with a focus on MATLAB implementations and analysis. We are continuously adding new content and improvements, so stay tuned for updates!
   
## Current Highlights

### 1. FFT Leakage and Windowing
- **Issue**: FFT leakage occurs when a signal's frequency components do not align perfectly with the FFT bin frequencies, causing energy to spread across multiple bins.
- **Impact**: This distorts the spectral representation, reduces frequency resolution, and makes it difficult to accurately measure the amplitude and frequency of the signal.
- **Solution**: Demonstrates the use of various windowing techniques to mitigate leakage effects and improve FFT accuracy.

### 2. Lowpass and Bandpass Filter Design
- **Methods**: 
  - Parks-McClellan algorithm
  - Kaiser window method
- **Focus**: Designing lowpass and bandpass filters to meet specific requirements.
- **Comparison**: Highlights the strengths and trade-offs of Parks-McClellan and Kaiser window methods.

### 3. FIR and IIR Filter Design
- **Filters Covered**:
  - **FIR Filters**: Equiripple and Kaiser window methods.
  - **IIR Filters**: Butterworth, Chebyshev I & II, and Elliptic filters.
- **Analysis**: Explores trade-offs and performance metrics such as:
  - Frequency response
  - Stability
  - Computational efficiency
